# Esercizio

Prendi il seguente testo (è in inglese perchè gli strumenti che usiamo - e riusciamo a trovare - processano l'inglese).&#x20;

> Anita Sarkeesian doesn’t give me the address of her San Francisco apartment over email. Instead, she texts it to me a few hours before we’re set to meet. After thousands of rape and death threats, a bomb scare and an email promising a mass shooting at one of her speaking events, a woman can’t be too careful. For some male gaming aficionados, the most frightening enemy isn’t an animated foe but this 31-year-old feminist with a penchant for hoop earrings, sitting across from me. They’ve called Sarkeesian a con artist, and raised thousands of dollars to film an exposé-style documentary about her (which exposes nothing). Some even created a game in which users can punch an image of her face until it is bloodied.

Processalo nei due ambienti sotto indicati. Prendi nota di ciò che osservi e caricalo nel Digipad.
