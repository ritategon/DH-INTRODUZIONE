# Il Close Reading e le fonti

### Prima definizione&#x20;

Il _**close reading**_ è un'attività che ti tiene concentrati su e all'interno di un testo, valutando singole parole, forme di pensiero, dispositivi retorici, modelli di descrizione e caratterizzazione e così via, al fine di comprendere il risultato artistico del testo. Si distingue dal e si intreccia con il _**distant reading**_, che ha un significato specifico (coniato da [Franco Moretti](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco\_Moretti)), ma può anche riferirsi generalmente all'uso di metodi computazionali per l'analisi dei testi letterari.

L'analisi del testo è qualcosa in cui ci impegniamo tutti, che ce ne rendiamo conto o meno. Il termine è ampio e racchiude una varietà di attività diverse. Anche qualcosa di semplice come rallentare quando vedi un segnale di stop è una sorta di analisi del testo: farlo significa che hai analizzato il significato delle parole sul segnale e hai reagito di conseguenza.

Dunque, le seguenti attività sono forme di analisi del testo:

* Parafrasare un testo
* Cercare significati nascosti in un testo
* Adattare un testo e riflettere su di esso&#x20;
* Esaminare i dettagli in un testo

This last point is worth pausing over: **close reading**, in particular, is often proclaimed as one of the primary analytical tool of scholars and students in the humanities. To read closely means to give careful attention to the various components that make up a text, ones which cause us to think or feel a certain way about it. Close reading relies on a core principle about the text under study:

Vale la pena soffermarsi su quest'ultimo punto: il **close reading,** in particolare, è spesso definito come uno dei principali strumenti analitici di studiosi e studenti delle discipline umanistiche. Leggere da vicino significa prestare molta attenzione alle varie componenti di un testo, quelle che ci fanno pensare o sentire in un certo modo riguardo ad esso. Il **close reading** si basa su un principio fondamentale:

* Everything about the text matters, whether the author intended for it to matter or not.

Consider the following thought experiment. One day you come home to find the following note from your roommate on the counter:

_Dai un occhio ai piatti? Grazie._

Next to the note: dirty dishes. Was your roommate in a hurry and actually asking you to wash dishes? Or were they sarcastically trying to give you grief for not having done your part? Lots of questions. To imagine responses to them you might employ a range of assumptions and interpretations depending on the scenario:

**Context**: you have been growing more and more irritated with your roommate for some time now. Their actions just really get under your skin: dirty dishes, laundry everywhere, the works. They clearly meant the note as an insult.

**Author**: your roommate is actually a great person and would never leave a passive aggressive note. In fact, they probably meant it as a joke.

**Text**: Take a look at that question mark. And then the curt second sentence. Your roommate put those things there on purpose to be rude.

The list could go on and on. We employ a similar range of skills when we read anything, be it fiction, poetry, or historical documents. Close reading might be best described as an activity in which a reader simply lets no detail of the text go unquestioned. The best way at approaching a good close reading is by asking (and attempting to answer) questions about every piece of a text.

Take a sentence from the 1775 _Anecdotes on the Countess du Barry_, a _libelle_ (which you can find [here](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/261/)) similar to the ones discussed in Sarah Maza's “The Diamond Necklace Affair Revisited: The Case of the Missing Queen.” Mme du Barry was a prostitute who was Louis XV's mistress at the end of his reign (1715-1774). Here is how the Count du Barry tells one of Louis XV's courtiers that he has a woman in mind for the king:

> "I’ve got your business for you. You know I don’t lack taste. Trust me: you come to dinner at my house and tell me that I’m a cad if I don’t give you the most beautiful woman, the most fresh, the most seductive; a true morsel for a king."

In beginning a close reading here, I might ask:

* What adjectives and nouns describe Mme du Barry here?
* More specifically, what does it mean that she is compared to a "business" or a "morsel"?
* If she is a piece of food, what does that mean about the relationship she might have with Louis XV?
* Why is she not named here?
* If you read the rest of the text, you'll see that most of the language in this excerpt is flowery -- but not the Count du Barry's words. What does that suggest about who he is and what his character is like?

You can answer these questions any number of ways, and this ambiguity is part of the point. Close reading as a method is a way of training yourself to look for details, the evidence that you will use to interpret a passage, but how you use them depends on you. This evidence becomes the material you use to produce an analysis of your own (sometimes also called a close reading). Using the questions about _Anecdotes on the Countess du Barry_, I might make the argument that these sentences establish her as an object, a commerical good or a commodity for the king's consumption. I might also think that the Count du Barry's words render him as vulgar and coarse, a figure unworthy of contact with the court of Versailles.

## Primary and Secondary Texts for Historical Analysis

In addition to reading texts closely, you also want to think about the kind of text you are working with and its relationship to its historical context. For starters, you need to know if the work you are reading is a **primary** text or a **secondary** text. [The Healey Library](http://umb.libguides.com/c.php?g=351019\&p=2367357) has a good set of definitions:

> **Primary Sources** are immediate, first-hand accounts of a topic, from people who had a direct connection with it. **Secondary Sources** are one step removed from primary sources, though they often quote or otherwise use primary sources. They can cover the same topic, but add a layer of interpretation and analysis.

Sarah Maza's article is a secondary text, whereas the _Anedcotes_, discussed above, is a primary text.

Reading primary texts is absolutely invaluable, particularly in the study of history. There is no better way to understand events in the past than by examining the sources – whether journals, newspaper articles, letters, court case records, novels, artworks, music or autobiographies – that people from that period left behind. However, you need to approach primary sources with care and as something other than a 100% accurate representation of the truth. For instance, in reading the _Anecdotes_, you might ask: did the author actually witness the events he or she was describing? Probably not. In that is the case, what can this document help us understand? And what can't we use it to do?

Thus, you want to read primary sources with a series of questions in mind. The following is adapted from a guide provided by [Carleton College](http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/history/study/):

1. What implicit and explicit messages does this text contain? What did the author choose NOT to talk about?
2. What do you know about the author? How might his or her beliefs or background have affected the writing of and views in this document?
3. Who constituted the intended audience? Was this source meant for one person's eyes or for the public? How does that affect the nature of the source?
4. Is it prescriptive (telling you what people thought should happen) or descriptive (telling you what people thought did happen)?
5. Does it tell you about the beliefs/actions of the elite, or of “ordinary” people? From whose perspective?
6. What historical questions can you answer using this source? What questions can this source NOT help you answer? What are the limitations of this type of source? What historical perspectives are left out of this source?
7. What assumptions do you see being made? What surprises you about this text?

For instance, take the following passage from the first paragraph of the _Anecdotes_:

> Advancing age and the ability of a great prince to satisfy all his passions had dulled his attraction towards women. But this need, though diminished, continued ... The doctors assured the King that it was dangerous to give up so abruptly a pleasure necessary for his existence.

At one level, this work is giving an account of how Louis XV and the Countess du Barry began their liaison. But these sentences also have an implicit message: the king's sexual desire for women was natural and indeed necessary to his well-being. This view that the king needed to have a mistress for the sake of his health may be surprising to you and it certainly reveals a set of assumptions about extra-marital activity at the time. So if we can't take this primary source as an accurate representation of the relationship between du Barry and the king, it does serve as a fascinating window into into the culture of late eighteenth-century France.

## Lettura Digitale

Interrogare le fonti in questo modo è solo una delle modalità di comprensione di un testo. Si basa sull'idea che l'attenzione prolungata su un documento permetterà di capire cose nuove su di esso. Questo stesso approccio può essere applicato praticamente a qualsiasi oggetto di studio, siano essi libri, film, musica o idee stesse. L'obiettivo principale in questo libro, quindi, è come il processo possa essere cambiato con l'introduzione della tecnologia. Potresti iniziare ponendo una serie di domande su come il close reading possa interagire con gli strumenti digitali.

* Possiamo ancora fare close reading se il computer legge per noi?
* In che modo il computer potrebbe modificare i tipi di close reading a nostra disposizione?&#x20;
* Applicando il close reading mediante gli strumenti digitali possiamo accedere a cosa cui prima non potevamo?
